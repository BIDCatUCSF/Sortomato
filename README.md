# Sortomato

The Sortomato is a utility for sorting Surpass objects into new objects based on their statistical properties. The Sortomato works with Spots and Surfaces objects. If the objects have custom statistical properties, they can also be used to sort the objects.

There are two versions of Sortomato available. Big Sortomato is an extended version of Sortomato with more functionality. 

Big Sortomato works with Matlab 2015 and Imaris 8.3 or newer. Small Sortomato has a couple of download options depending on software versions used.
